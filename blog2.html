Crypto investing can be exciting, but many beginners fall into the same traps — costing them time, money, and confidence. Here are the top five mistakes we see (and how you can avoid them):

### 1. **Chasing Hype Instead of Researching**
Don't just buy what’s trending on Twitter. Real gems are often found through research — not hype.

### 2. **Ignoring Risk Management**
Putting all your funds into one coin is risky. Diversify, set stop losses, and don’t invest money you can’t afford to lose.

### 3. **FOMO Buying**
Buying at the top because "everyone’s talking about it" leads to regret. Be patient — prices cycle.

### 4. **Selling Too Early (or Too Late)**
New investors often panic-sell on dips or hold too long in hopes of moonshots. Have a plan. Take profits strategically.

### 5. **Not Having a Long-Term Vision**
True wealth is built over time. The crypto space rewards patience, consistency, and learning.
